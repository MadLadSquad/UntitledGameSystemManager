A linux gaming system manager
## About
UntitledLinuxGameManager is a cli/gui program to help with managing a linux gaming system.

It automatically creates an Ubuntu container with the latest updates and software, and gives you a nice gui/cli interface to manage the programs in the container.

Using a container users can:
- isolate their gaming system from the host
- easily backup, redeploy or move their system
- increase game/program stability and compatibility
## Dependencies
The manager requires the following to be installed on your system:
- X
- PulseAudio
- glxinfo
- An AMD/Intel/Nvidia GPU with supported drivers
- The cli install scripts require bash, since for now they include bash isms and don't fully conform
## Install
